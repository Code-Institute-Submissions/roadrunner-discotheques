## Aim of the site

The site is designed at the request of Hugh Naismith of Roadrunner Discotheques to allow prospective customers to view a summary of the business and the services it can provide. A contact page containing phone numbers and an contact form also allow the user to get in touch with Hugh to discuss future business.

## UX

To help provide a good UX the site was designed using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap"), it was key in making this a mobile-first design but also makes sure that all aspects of the design are responsive to any device size. 

## Wireframe Mockups

Before starting the project I sat with the client and put together a few wirefrae mockups so we had an idea of what we were trying to create and what we needed to include. It also allowed us to see how the features would scaled and incorporated over various device sizes.

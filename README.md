# Rodrunner Discotheques

Roadrunner Discotheques provides entertainment, music and lights packages for major events and parties throughtout Central Scotland.

## Purpose

The site is designed at the request of Hugh Naismith of Roadrunner Discotheques to allow prospective customers to view a summary of the business and the services it can provide. A contact page containing phone numbers and a contact form also allow the user to get in touch with Hugh to discuss future business. The hope is that this can bring the business to a larger audience and help with current plans for expansion. The site is aimed at anyone looking to plan a party or event and is looking to add those professional touches and a tailored service.

## Wireframe Mockups

Before starting the project I sat with the client and put together a few wireframe mockups so we had an idea of what we were trying to create and what we needed to include. It also allowed us to see how the features would scaled and incorporated over various device sizes. These were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/ "Balsamiq"):

* [Contact Page Wireframe Mockups](/assets/wireframes/rrwf-contact.png)
* [Services Pages Wireframe Mockups](/assets/wireframes/rrwf-sevices.png)

As you can see there hasn't been too much shift in the design throughout the process.

## Theme

The red, white and charcoal theme used throughout the project was chosen to stay true to the already established colours of Roadrunner Discotheques. Charcoal was used to replace black from the company's original colour scheme to bring a softer overall feel to the site.

## UX

To help provide a good UX the site was designed using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap"), it was key in making this a mobile-first design but also makes sure that all aspects of the design are responsive to any device size.
